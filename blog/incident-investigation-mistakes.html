            <p>Every year, organizations spend thousands of hours investigating workplace incidents. Forms are filled, interviews conducted, reports written. Yet the same types of incidents keep happening.</p>
            <p>Why? Because most investigations make the same fundamental mistakes.</p>
            <p>Here are the five most common—and how to avoid them.</p>

            <h2>Mistake #1: Stopping at "Human Error"</h2>
            <div class="mistake-box">
                <strong class="text-red-400">The problem:</strong> An investigation concludes that a worker "failed to follow procedure" or "made a mistake." Case closed.
            </div>
            <p>Except it's not closed. Nothing has been learned. And the same error will happen again—probably soon—because the <em>conditions</em> that made the error possible haven't changed.</p>
            <p><strong>The reality:</strong> Human error is never a root cause. It's a starting point for investigation.</p>
            <p>When someone makes a mistake, ask:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Why did the action make sense to them at the time?</li>
                <li>What information did they have (or lack)?</li>
                <li>What pressures were they under?</li>
                <li>Why didn't the system catch or prevent the error?</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="fix-box">
                <strong class="text-green-400">The fix:</strong> Whenever your investigation identifies a human error, treat it as a symptom. Keep asking "why" until you reach organizational factors.
            </div>
            <p><strong>Example transformation:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>❌ "Operator failed to lock out equipment before maintenance"</li>
                <li>✅ "Production pressure led supervisor to approve shortcut. Lockout procedure was 45 minutes long, designed for annual shutdowns, not quick repairs. No alternative procedure existed for minor maintenance."</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Mistake #2: Confusing "What" with "Why"</h2>
            <div class="mistake-box">
                <strong class="text-red-400">The problem:</strong> Investigations document what happened in excruciating detail but never explain why it happened.
            </div>
            <p>You end up with a 20-page report that tells you the worker was standing in the wrong place at the wrong time—but not why they were there, or why being there was dangerous.</p>
            <p><strong>The reality:</strong> "What" questions describe the incident. "Why" questions explain it.</p>
            <p>The purpose of investigation isn't to create a historical record. It's to understand causation so you can prevent recurrence.</p>
            <div class="fix-box">
                <strong class="text-green-400">The fix:</strong> For every fact in your investigation, ask "So what?" If you can't connect it to causation, it doesn't belong.
            </div>
            <p>Test your investigation with the "Five Whys":</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Why did this happen?</li>
                <li>Why did that happen?</li>
                <li>Why did <em>that</em> happen?</li>
                <li>Why did <em>that</em> happen?</li>
                <li>Why did <em>that</em> happen?</li>
            </ol>
            <p>If you can't answer at least five levels deep, you haven't finished.</p>

            <h2>Mistake #3: Treating All Incidents the Same</h2>
            <div class="mistake-box">
                <strong class="text-red-400">The problem:</strong> Every incident—from a stubbed toe to a serious injury—gets the same superficial investigation. A form is filled, a box is ticked, and everyone moves on.
            </div>
            <p><strong>The reality:</strong> Investigation effort should match incident significance—but significance isn't just about outcomes.</p>
            <p>A near-miss with high potential severity deserves more investigation than a minor injury with no systemic implications. The goal is learning, not paperwork.</p>
            <div class="fix-box">
                <strong class="text-green-400">The fix:</strong> Triage incidents by learning potential, not just outcome:
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Full ICAM investigation:</strong> Serious outcomes OR high-potential incidents</li>
                <li><strong>Focused investigation:</strong> Moderate potential, clear contributing factors</li>
                <li><strong>Quick review:</strong> Low potential, isolated occurrence, no systemic factors</li>
            </ul>
            <p>But here's the key: even quick reviews should identify whether deeper investigation is needed. A pattern of "minor" incidents often signals a major incident waiting to happen.</p>

            <h2>Mistake #4: Writing Recommendations No One Will Follow</h2>
            <div class="mistake-box">
                <strong class="text-red-400">The problem:</strong> Your investigation concludes with recommendations like "Workers must be more careful," "Improve communication," or "Provide additional training."
            </div>
            <p>These aren't recommendations. They're wishes.</p>
            <p><strong>The reality:</strong> Vague recommendations don't get implemented. Even when they do, they don't change anything.</p>
            <p>"Retrain all workers" feels like action, but it usually means showing people the same ineffective training they've already forgotten.</p>
            <div class="fix-box">
                <strong class="text-green-400">The fix:</strong> Every recommendation should pass the SMART test:
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Specific:</strong> Exactly what will change?</li>
                <li><strong>Measurable:</strong> How will you verify it worked?</li>
                <li><strong>Actionable:</strong> Who will do it, and by when?</li>
                <li><strong>Relevant:</strong> Does this address a root cause?</li>
                <li><strong>Timely:</strong> Can it be implemented before another incident occurs?</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Example transformation:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>❌ "Improve lockout/tagout compliance"</li>
                <li>✅ "By March 1, maintenance supervisor will develop 5-minute lockout procedure for minor equipment repairs, pilot with night shift, and revise based on feedback. Track compliance through supervisor observation during week 2."</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Mistake #5: Investigating in Isolation</h2>
            <div class="mistake-box">
                <strong class="text-red-400">The problem:</strong> Each incident is investigated as if it's unique. No one looks for patterns. Learning stays siloed.
            </div>
            <p><strong>The reality:</strong> Most incidents aren't unique. They're manifestations of systemic issues that affect multiple areas.</p>
            <p>If you're having lockout/tagout incidents in maintenance, you probably have procedure issues everywhere. If time pressure contributed to one incident, it's contributing to risk across your operation.</p>
            <div class="fix-box">
                <strong class="text-green-400">The fix:</strong> Build investigation into a learning system.
            </div>
            <p><strong>During investigation:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Review past similar incidents</li>
                <li>Look for recurring contributing factors</li>
                <li>Ask whether this incident reveals systemic issues</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>After investigation:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Share findings beyond the affected area</li>
                <li>Track contributing factors across incidents</li>
                <li>Look for organizational factors that appear repeatedly</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Underlying Problem</h2>
            <p>All five mistakes stem from the same root cause: treating investigation as compliance activity rather than learning opportunity.</p>
            <p>When investigation is about filling forms, you get superficial analysis, standardized treatment, checkbox recommendations, and isolated findings.</p>
            <p>When investigation is about learning, you get deep understanding of why, proportionate effort for proportionate learning, actionable changes, and organizational learning that prevents recurrence.</p>

            <h2>How to Transform Your Investigations</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Change the question.</strong> Instead of "What went wrong?" ask "What can we learn?"</li>
                <li><strong>Invest in capability.</strong> Train investigators in methodology, interview techniques, and analysis.</li>
                <li><strong>Create psychological safety.</strong> People won't share honest information if they fear blame.</li>
                <li><strong>Use structured methodology.</strong> Frameworks like ICAM provide rigor and consistency.</li>
                <li><strong>Follow through.</strong> Track recommendations, verify implementation, measure effectiveness.</li>
                <li><strong>Share learning.</strong> Investigation findings should reach everyone who can benefit.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The goal isn't perfect investigations. It's genuine organizational learning that makes your workplace safer over time.</p>
